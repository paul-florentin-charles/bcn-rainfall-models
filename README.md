> As of 07/02/2025, project is split into 2 main entities:
> 1. A "backend" made of:
>    1. **Custom classes** to easily load and manipulate _rainfall data_ from Barcelona.
>    2. An **API** written with FastAPI that exposes this data.
> 2. A **Webapp** run with Flask that calls the latter API to display data.
>
> The idea is the mid-run would be to split both entities into different repositories. 
> 
> Perhaps even make 3 repositories, and package them by the following order of priority:
> 1. Custom classes
> 2. API
> 3. Webapp

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Pip
